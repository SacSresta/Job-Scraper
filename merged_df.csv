Assistant Social Researcher,"About BPA Analytics
BPA is a Brisbane-based company with 30 years of expertise in analysing and advising on how to manage Organisational Culture as an organisational asset.  This is our core business.
At its most basic, Organisational Culture is all about “How we do things around here”.
We make extensive use of narrative text research to unpack what an organisation’s culture is actually doing.  And we advise organisational executive on how to build their cultural strengths and reduce/eliminate the behaviours that are unacceptable or undesirable.
BPA's office is located in the Brisbane CBD and is close to many public transport options.
About the Position
The Assistant Social Researcher will join our Culture Analytics Team (yes, the CATs) and will develop into the role by building skill-sets in a range of research activities:
Survey management
Linguistic analytics
Benchmarking analytics
Research mapping
Quality control
Report & presentation preparation
The CATs are a deliberately eclectic group.  They have a range of degrees, including Psychological Science, Sociology, Humanities, Publishing, and Applied Science.  Their common bond is a serious interest in digging into data to discover the underlying themes, and a relentless focus on the quality of what they do.
About You
This position doesn’t require a specific degree, but you do need to be a thinking person who loves learning and getting things done. We will teach you about all the specific types of analytics you will do.
But it would really suit someone who sees Organisational Culture as “their jam”, the thing that incites their passion and sense of discovery. If you have a background in Sociology, Organisational Development,  or Organisational Psychology, then this could suit your interests. We have a very practice-based (rather than academic) way of working with culture - when you check out our website, you will see what I mean. 
This position will suit applicants of any age – there is no age limit on what makes a good researcher in organisational culture.  It will be important for you to have full-time work experience – in any industry.  The more life experience you have, the better you can understand the stories that people are telling us about working in their organisations – the good and the bad.
About BPA’s Culture
BPA's culture is friendly, open, professional & full of opportunities to learn new things.  We set “the bar” high and it would normally take about 2 years for a new employee to have accumulated enough skills and experience to reach that bar.  Let me describe how it works, so you can decide whether this is for you or not.
If you want a workplace where:
You can grow a wide range of strengths & skill sets in the organisational culture field; and
Hard work, diligence and caring about “getting it right” for our clients is the norm; and
Opportunities and pay are based on how well you build your skill-sets; and
Your normal workday requires you to focus and work well under commercial pressure; and
You really want to accumulate some serious experience that ramps up your employability.
…Then BPA could be a good place for you because this is our culture.
About the Pay
The starting salary is $65,000 p.a. plus superannuation.  On completing probation, it goes to $70,000 and the pay increases as your skill-sets increase – up to $120,000 for a Principal Social Researcher.
How to Apply
If you think that Organisational Culture is:
“your jam”, and
you could bring a strong capability to this role, 
then please send us a Cover Letter addressing these two points. Please send your CV too, but your Cover Letter is the prime piece for you to use in arguing your case.
To apply, send your Cover Letter and CV to WeAreHiring@bpanz.com.
If you have any questions, just ring (07) 3367-0613 and ask for Genevieve Meggitt, Office Manager or email her at Genevieve.Meggitt@bpanz.com.
