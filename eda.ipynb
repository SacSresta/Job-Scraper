This is our core business.\\nAt its most basic, Organisational Culture is all about “How we do things around here”.\\nWe make extensive use of narrative text research to unpack what an organisation’s culture is actually doing.  And we advise organisational executive on how to build their cultural strengths and reduce/eliminate the behaviours that are unacceptable or undesirable.\\nBPA's office is located in the Brisbane CBD and is close to many public transport options.\\nAbout the Position\\nThe Assistant Social Researcher will join our Culture Analytics Team (yes, the CATs) and will develop into the role by building skill-sets in a range of research activities:\\nSurvey management\\nLinguistic analytics\\nBenchmarking analytics\\nResearch mapping\\nQuality control\\nReport & presentation preparation\\nThe CATs are a deliberately eclectic group.  They have a range of degrees, including Psychological Science, Sociology, Humanities, Publishing, and Applied Science.  Their common bond is a serious interest in digging into data to discover the underlying themes, and a relentless focus on the quality of what they do.\\nAbout You\\nThis position doesn’t require a specific degree, but you do need to be a thinking person who loves learning and getting things done. We will teach you about all the specific types of analytics you will do.\\nBut it would really suit someone who sees Organisational Culture as “their jam”, the thing that incites their passion and sense of discovery. If you have a background in Sociology, Organisational Development,  or Organisational Psychology, then this could suit your interests. We have a very practice-based (rather than academic) way of working with culture - when you check out our website, you will see what I mean. \\nThis position will suit applicants of any age – there is no age limit on what makes a good researcher in organisational culture.  It will be important for you to have full-time work experience – in any industry.  The more life experience you have, the better you can understand the stories that people are telling us about working in their organisations – the good and the bad.\\nAbout BPA’s Culture\\nBPA's culture is friendly, open, professional & full of opportunities to learn new things.  We set “the bar” high and it would normally take about 2 years for a new employee to have accumulated enough skills and experience to reach that bar.  Let me describe how it works, so you can decide whether this is for you or not.\\nIf you want a workplace where:\\nYou can grow a wide range of strengths & skill sets in the organisational culture field; and\\nHard work, diligence and caring about “getting it right” for our clients is the norm; and\\nOpportunities and pay are based on how well you build your skill-sets; and\\nYour normal workday requires you to focus and work well under commercial pressure; and\\nYou really want to accumulate some serious experience that ramps up your employability.\\n…Then BPA could be a good place for you because this is our culture.\\nAbout the Pay\\nThe starting salary is $65,000 p.a. plus superannuation.  On completing probation, it goes to $70,000 and the pay increases as your skill-sets increase – up to $120,000 for a Principal Social Researcher.\\nHow to Apply\\nIf you think that Organisational Culture is:\\n“your jam”, and\\nyou could bring a strong capability to this role, \\nthen please send us a Cover Letter addressing these two points.
